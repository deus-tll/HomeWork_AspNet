[{"Header":"What Is C#?","TextContent":"C# is a modern, general-purpose programming language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks and objectives that span over a variety of professions. C# is primarily used on the Windows .NET framework, although it can be applied to an open source platform. This highly versatile programming language is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) and comparably new to the game, yet a reliable crowd pleaser."},{"Header":"When was C# created?","TextContent":"When compared to long-standing languages like Python and PHP, C# is a young addition to the programming family at nearly twenty years old. The language was developed in the year 2000 by Microsoft’s Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish software engineer with a history for popular creations. Anders has taken part in the creation of a handful of dependable programming tools and languages, including Microsoft’s TypeScript and Delphi, a suitable replacement for Turbo Pascal.<br class=\"line-break\">As of November 2022, C# ranked #4 on the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language Index, right behind Java and JavaScript. The data used to compile this index is based on how often people search for a tutorial on different programming languages in Google.<br class=\"line-break\">C# has also made a consistent appearance in the top ten programming languages in the TIOBE Index, a report that pulls its data from a compilation of popular search engines including Google, YouTube and Bing."},{"Header":"Where did C# get its name?","TextContent":"In the beginning, C# was originally titled COOL, a clever acronym that stood for “C-like Object Oriented Language.” Unfortunately, Microsoft was unable to hang onto the fun name for reasons having to do with trademark law.<br class=\"line-break\">C# was originally designed to rival Java. Judging by the quick rise to popularity and the positive response from both new and seasoned developers, it’s safe to say that goal has been achieved."}]
