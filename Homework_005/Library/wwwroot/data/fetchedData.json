They've set a trap for Frank, using a low-level mob enforcer named Wilson Fisk to play the part of the \"Kingpin of Crime,\" an imaginary figure they know Frank won't be able to resist. With their trap set, the bosses have only to wait for the Punisher to take the bait. But the bosses aren't the only people with a plan. It seems that Wilson Fisk is tired of playing the heavy.
